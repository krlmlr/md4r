Description: This package provides an R wrapper for the MD4C (Markdown for C) library. 
    It provides basic markdown parsing (CommonMark compliant) along with support for other common
    markdown extensions (e.g. GitHub flavored markdown, LaTeX equation support, etc.). The 
    package also provides a number of high level functions for exploring and manipulating markdown
    as well as translating and displaying documents.
