* This is a new release.

## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Fixed the formatting of NEWS.md to resolve the NOTE.

* Replaced ASTs in the description with "abstract syntax trees".

* I believe that LaTeX and CommonMark are the correct spelling and have been left as is.
