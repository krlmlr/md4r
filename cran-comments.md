* This is a new release.

## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added single quotes around MD4C, LaTeX, and CommonMark in the description.

* Added John MacFarlane to the copyright entry.

* CRAN feedback also mentioned adding references to the description field in the 
  DESCRIPTION file. At this time there are no such references that I am aware
  of and have therefore not made any additional changes here.
